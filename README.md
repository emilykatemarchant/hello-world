General notes about me and my projects
<em> About Me </em>
<p>I graduate 3 years ago from a Literature degree and masters, and ever since I have been measuring my life back to that moment. I love school and learning, so I figured that I should start teaching myself something new. I chose coding because I used to love maths, and I spend the rest of my time doing hobbies and work that are much more fluid and lateral. So coding is a good counterpoint and will hopefully hold my interest.</p>
